				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Although reducing drug costs improves the chances patients will take their prescriptions, it’s not the whole answer.</h2>
<p>In 2006, Medicare Part D was expanded. As a result, the percentage of people over 65 with insurance to help pay for drugs jumped from 65 percent to over 90 percent. The increased coverage cut hospitalizations by 8 percent and decreased annual Medicare costs for hospitalization by 7 percent during the program&#8217;s first four years. An estimated $1.5 billion was saved annually, according to <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w19948" target="_blank">new research</a> published February 2014 in the <i>National Bureau of Economic Research</i>.</p>
<p>But for people who don’t have prescription drug plans and who are not eligible for Medicare, drug costs can be a burden. It can lead some people to stop taking their medications. According to a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2842539/" target="_blank">paper</a> published in the <i>Journal of General Internal Medicine</i>, between 20 to 30 percent of prescriptions are never filled.</p>

<p>“Certainly, very high out-of-pocket costs can keep people from taking a drug regularly,” Ed Pezalla, national medical director at Aetna, said. “Lowering copays can help, but that alone doesn’t fix the complex problem of medication adherence.”</p>
<p>In collaboration with Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Aetna gave free heart drugs to patients who had just suffered heart attacks. But this effort only raised patient drug adherence from 42 percent to 49 percent.</p>
<blockquote class="offset right"><p>“Reducing prescription drug costs only raised patient adherence from 42 percent to 49 percent.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“We did cut subsequent heart attacks and some admissions and procedures, so the cost of the medication was more than offset by the savings from patients doing better,” Pezalla said. “But we could not break that 50 percent mark with just free drugs. And this was after people had a heart attack.”</p>
<p>The effectiveness and savings of reducing drug costs for other diseases, such as diabetes, is harder to quantify.</p>
<p>“We have programs where we reduce the out-of-pocket payment for diabetes medication,” Pezalla said. “In the long-run that can work, but in the short-run you don’t see much improvement in medical costs.”</p>
<p>More research is showing the clinical and economic benefits of expanding drug coverage. In response, insurers may begin to expand the number of drugs they cover and the scope of people eligible for coverage.</p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act increased public health awareness. So doctors may begin prescribing medications, knowing their patient is covered under the new law.</p>
